# Charity Website Project

## Overview
This project is a functional digital storefront, created to promote and support the sales of a small business.
The website has two main sections: the **public-facing front-end** for users to learn about business and it's products, and the **administrative back-end** for managing product orders through an integrated system.

The public side focuses on visual design and accessibility, while the back-end is built to handle functional requirements like order processing and database management.
This project was developed as part of a final course project, showcasing skills in both **front-end** and **back-end development**.

### Features:
1. **Public Side (Front-End)**:
   - Provides detailed information about the small business and its mission.
   - Displays items with details such as descriptions and availability.
   - Enables users to browse through available products using an interactive interface.

2. **Administrative Side (Back-End)**:
   - Allows users to place orders for products using an order form.
   - Orders are processed using **PHP**, and data is stored and retrieved from a **MySQL database**.
   - Administrative users can manage inventory, track orders, and maintain product information.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**:
  - **HTML/CSS**: Used to structure and style the public-facing side of the website, ensuring a clean, responsive design.
  - **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity, such as dynamically displaying product information and validating order forms.
  
- **Back-End**:
  - **PHP**: Handles order processing and interacts with the back-end database.
  - **MySQL**: Stores product data, order information, and manages user input from the front-end.

## Example Use Case
### Front-End:
A user visits the website and navigates to the product page, where they see various products available for purchase. Each candle comes with a description and image. The user selects fig tree and places an order for 2 units, entering their details through an interactive form.

### Back-End:
Upon form submission, the PHP script processes the order and stores it in a MySQL database. The admin can then access the back-end interface to view and manage the order, update inventory, and track any upcoming deliveries.
